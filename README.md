# eugeniosarritzu.com

In early 2023, I decided to learn about the technologies below to build my personal website. I also learned about Vercel and the great developer experience it provides to make all these technologies come together into something easily sharable with the world.

- **Component Framework**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- **App Framework**: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Inspiration, Component Library & Learning Resources

The following websites below served as inspiration to create my own.

- [leerob.io](https://leerob.io/)
- [transitivebullsh.it](https://transitivebullsh.it/)
- [matteing.com](https://matteing.com/)
- [craftz.dog](https://www.craftz.dog/)

I also used this great library by [Captain Codeman](https://www.captaincodeman.com/) for a few Svelte headless UI components.

- [svelte-headlessui](https://captaincodeman.github.io/svelte-headlessui/)

Last but not least, these learning resources were of great help while building this website.

- [Joy Of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/)
- [New Svelte Interactive Tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte)
- [Original Svelte Interactive Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)
- [Vercel's Next.js Start Learning Guide](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs)

## TODO

There are still a few things I want to do with this website:

- [ ] Add a global `404` page
- [ ] Implement my /blog with MDX or Sanity.io
- [ ] Update the /projects page after shipping my first side projects in 2023.
- [ ] Add [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) as a learning exercise
- [ ] Implement security practices per [leerob's repo](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/main/next.config.js) - find out the equivalent for SvelteKit
- [ ] Add script to make the deletion of personal information easy for others, inspired by [leerob's setup script](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/main/lib/setup.mjs).
